add-favorite.sh

This is a script for Gnome users that can 'favorite', or pin, an application if you don't see the option to do so when right-clicking the running application.  That's something that shouldn't really happen, but I ran into it once with a specific application in Zorin OS.  I created this script so I wouldn't have to remember what to do if it happens again.

You'll need to create a .desktop launcher and then provide it as a command-line argument to the script.  The script will take care of the rest.  For information on how to create a launcher, see https://askubuntu.com/a/64237.
